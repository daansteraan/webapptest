					<h4> <b> Why Flask?</b> </h4>
					<p> Python is a great language for people who don't like syntax. It's quick to learn and there are tons of resources. Ruby is similar in that respect and sites made with Ruby on Rails look awesome. </p>
					<p> I chose Python because web apps are not the only thing I want to use Python for, it's not even the main thing! And Python is just that, a programming language that you can use for many different things. </p>
					<p>	This is how I learned the basics :</p>
					<ol><li> <a href='www.codeacademy.com'>Codeacademy</a> - don't stay longer than you have to</li>
					<li> <a href='www.coursera.org'>Coursera</a> - take your pick! I still do a course there from time to time. </li>
					<li> <a href='www.reddit.com/r/DailyProgrammer'>Reddit/DailyProgrammer</a> - there are many communities out there. This one is very helpful. Great to see other people's code as well. </li>
					<li> <a href='www.google.com'>Google, baby</a> - you're bound to bump into stackoverflow.com or pythonprogramming.net etc., just do it. Learn something new wherever you can.</li></ol>
					<p> Lastly, make this your mantra - 
					<blockquote> A.B.C. : Always Be Coding. </blockquote>
						You might be told that you need a project to learn anything but it's not essential. Just keep doing something. Projects will come and go. </p>

					<h4> <b>How Flask?</b> </h4>
					<p>I read a quote by a long time programmer who said that only knowing one language is like only having one tool in your toolbox. Now Python might be a fancy mutli-tool, but try as you might to avoid it, you need to get to know more languages. I was truly dismaid (still am) finding this out.</p>
					<p>It's worth noting that you're bound to hear a lot about JavaScript and Node.js, especially with web stuff. I am rather keen to check these out before I look further into Ruby because JavaScript seems like it has a special place in web development and the community is growing.</p>
					<p>For the same reasons you can ignore PHP.</p>
					<p>If nothing else, at some point you're giong to have to come to grips with the basics of HTTP, CSS, and some DB (MongoDB, NoSQL, MySQL etc). Don't turn your nose up at other tools. Keep reading. </p>
