# webapptest

Having a go at setting up a few pages with flask and hosting locally. playing around with some bootrap while I'm at it. 

Now that I have done substantially more html/css/jquery (www.codepen.io/daansteraan) I would set these pages up quite a bit differently on the front-end side; although this was more just an experiment to see what's happening with the back-end.
