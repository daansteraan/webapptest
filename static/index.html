					<h4> <b> So what the hell is this?</b> </h4>
					<p> This site exists so that you can find out how it was made, and so that I can too. While I am making it.</p>
					<p> I will bump my head many times. But I'm okay with that. Our generation wants to learn , understand and - beyond everything - <i><b> HAVE </i></b> things immedaitely. This site is aimed and getting something up and running as soon as possible so that you have a playground to start building sand castles in.</p>
					<p>	Among other things, we will discuss:<br>
					<ul><li> Python for web </li>
					<li> Flask as a framework </li>
					<li> Bootstrap and (unfortunately) HTML - lazy version though </li>
					<li> Deployment - again.. the lazy version.</li></ul>
					</p>

					<h4> <b> No hand holding...</b> </h4>
					<p> This is all about quick and easy right? So go ahead and download the latest <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda's</a> package. You'll get Python interpreter and Spyder which is a great IDE to start with.</p>
	
					<p>At the moment I'm using Notepad++ and running my programs in windows powershell. I've played with several IDE's and you end up staying with whatever you like and it doesn't make a difference. Spyder is a good one to start with though.</p>

				<h4><strong> Where to start. </strong></h4>
				<p> Let's go for it, the site's content is writing itself so let's start - CLICK <a href="/python/" text="HERE">HERE</a>. <blockquote> A web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of dynamic websites, web applications, web services and web resources. The framework aims to alleviate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development.</blockquote><br>
